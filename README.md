### 🚀 About Me

I’m **Nathan Yao**, a computer science student at **Carnegie Mellon University (’27)** passionate about building technology that makes real-world impact — from optimizing public transit to protecting the environment.  

My work often lives at the intersection of **data, software, and social good**. I’ve developed:
- an **image-processing system** at *Gravitas Medical* to automate medical diagnostics,
- a **bus stop optimization algorithm** for *Santa Clara VTA* using K-means and GIS data,
- and an **environmental dashboard** tracking real-time air and noise quality in Alviso.  

Beyond engineering, I lead **youth-driven projects** that bring technology into the community:
- Co-directed the *Alviso Environmental Dashboard* and *AI for Good workshops* that reached over 200 students.
- Designed and led **five public mural projects** across Santa Clara County—combining environmental education, youth art, and flood awareness, now seen by 20,000+ visitors yearly.  
- Co-founded **Tahoma Hacks**, my district’s first hackathon, and helped expand STEM opportunities for underrepresented students.  
- Developed a **Fire Safety Education Game** with the *San Jose Firefighter Foundation* to teach kids lifesaving habits through gameplay.  

I’m deeply motivated by the idea that **code can serve communities** — that a few lines of logic, paired with creativity, can make cities cleaner, education more accessible, and people safer.  

**Languages:** Python, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, SML  
**Frameworks & Tools:** OpenCV, FastAPI, React, Node.js, Pandas, PyMongo, Segment Anything

### 💼 Featured Projects

#### 🩺 [Gravitas Medical Data Pipeline] *(Private Work Project for Gravitas Medical Inc.)*  
Architected an automated **OpenCV + Segment Anything** image-processing pipeline to analyze medical feeding tube electrodes.  
Processed **400+ device images in under 10 minutes**, replacing days of manual review and improving data accuracy.

#### 🚎 [VTA Bus Optimization](https://github.com/nathandyao) *(Private Work Project for VTA)*  
Designed **K-means and nearest-neighbor algorithms** to optimize bus stop placement for students.  
Reduced maximum walk times by over **30%** using GIS and demographic datasets.

#### 🌎 [Alviso Environmental Dashboard](https://github.com/cpmentorship/alviso_env_dashboard)  [Data Collector Framework](https://github.com/cpmentorship/datacollector)
Built a **Python + FastAPI** dashboard to visualize air and noise quality in real time.  
Integrated **SparkFun sensors with Raspberry Pi** and created RESTful APIs for live environmental tracking.
Created a modular Python framework for **sensor data collection and processing**, supporting multiple device protocols and real-time uploads. 

#### ☁️ [Azure Data API Server](https://github.com/cpmentorship/azure_data_api_server)  
Developed a **cloud-based API server** to collect and analyze environmental sensor data.  
Implemented efficient MongoDB data storage and a robust REST API layer for easy integration.
